Something should be done about the miner getting flagged as a trojan by windows defender (and likely other AVs).
It took 4 attempts to finally be able to get my system to allow the download on my laptop.
I realize that this is an issue that other mining software's suffer from however many have been able to overcome this and don't get flagged.
Having to turn off an AV even temporarily isn't a good work around for dealing with a false positive.
I'm sorry if I put this in the wrong place. I was unable to find another means of communicating this to you the developer(s).
